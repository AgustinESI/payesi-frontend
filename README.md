## Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:
- Node.js (v16.x or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Angular CLI (v15 or later) – install it globally using:
  ```
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```
## Setting Up the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <frontend-repository-url>
   cd <frontend-project-directory>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
## Running the Application
To serve the Angular application locally, run the following command:
